# AirFly Insights: Data Visualization and Analysis of Airline Operations



AirFly Insights is a comprehensive data analysis project that explores large-scale airline flight data to uncover operational trends, delay patterns, and cancellation reasons. The project aims to provide actionable insights for airline operators and analysts through advanced data visualization techniques.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and visual analysis.
-   **`src/`**: Contains the source code for data loading, processing, and utility functions.
-   **`data/`**: Directory for storing raw and processed datasets (ignored by Git, but structure is maintained).
-   **`outputs/`**: Folder for saving visualization exports and analysis results.
-   **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

1.  Standard installation: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
